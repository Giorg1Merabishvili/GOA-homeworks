    <h1>How i got into Goa

    </h1>
    <p>I came across GOA while scrolling online. It caught my attention because it didn't look like the usual boring programming stuff it actually seemed fun and creative.<br>
        So I looked into it more, liked what I saw, and decided to apply.
        Now I'm learning how to code.
