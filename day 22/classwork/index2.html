    <h1>Vincent van Gogh</h1>

    <p>Vincent van Gogh <B>was born on March 30, 1853, in Zundert, Netherlands.</B> He was the eldest surviving son in a religious,<br>
         middle-class family. His father was a Protestant minister, and Vincent grew up in a strict and disciplined environment.<br>
          From early on, he was sensitive, introspective, and drawn to nature.
        He tried several careers in his early adulthood—art dealer, teacher, and missionary—before fully committing to art at the age of 27.</p>
