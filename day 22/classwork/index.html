<h2>Leonardo da Vinci</h2>

     He was the illegitimate son of a notary, Ser Piero, and a peasant woman named Caterina. From an early age,<br>
      Leonardo showed a passion for art and curiosity about the natural world.

     Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence, where he learned painting,<br>
     sculpture, and mechanical arts.
