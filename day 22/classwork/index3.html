      <h1>Pablo Picasso</h1>

<p>Picasso <b>was born on October 25, 1881, in Málaga, Spain.</b> His father was an art teacher,<br>
     and young Pablo showed artistic talent from a very early age — he completed his first painting<br>
      at age 9 and began formal art training shortly after. His first words were reportedly<br>
      “pencil,” and by age 13, he was outpainting his own father.
